                  <p>The eye camps conducted on July 2021 and 2nd October 2021 were organized with the primary objective of providing essential eye healthcare services to the community, particularly to those who face challenges in accessing regular eye check-ups and treatments.

By facilitating these eye camps, the initiative aimed to address the disparities in healthcare accessibility, ensuring that the underserved segments of the community received much-needed eye care services, thus contributing to the overall improvement of their ocular health and quality of life.</p>
